"# canada_museum_clustering" 

Introduction
In this lab, you'll create two clustering models (DBSCAN and HDBSCAN) using data curated by StatCan containing the names, types, and locations of cultural and art facilities across Canada. We'll focus on the museum locations provided across Canada.

A collection of open data containing the names, types, and locations of cultural and art facilities across Canada. It is released under the Open Government License - Canada. The different types of facilities are labeled under 'ODCAF_Facility_Type'.
